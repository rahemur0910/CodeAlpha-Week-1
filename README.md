Task 1 : Age Calculator
Task 2: TODO APP

Developing an Age Calculator was an insightful project that allowed me to blend HTML, CSS, and JavaScript seamlessly. The objective was clear: create a user-friendly interface where individuals could input their birthdate and instantly receive their current age.

Crafting the HTML structure was straightforward, providing the foundation for user interaction. CSS styling enhanced the interface, making it visually appealing and intuitive. I utilized JavaScript to handle the calculation logic, extracting the birthdate value, computing the age relative to the current date, and dynamically updating the result on the webpage.

Throughout the project, I gained valuable experience in integrating front-end technologies to deliver a practical utility. Moreover, it reinforced my understanding of event handling, DOM manipulation, and date operations in JavaScript. Overall, this project not only sharpened my coding skills but also highlighted the power of web development in creating useful tools for everyday tasks.
